                        Carpet provides actual thermal insulation and resistance, or R-value.
                        In colder climates or seasons, it retains warm air longer, an energy conservation benefit.
                        Carpet also provides a comfortable place to sit, play, or work and gives a room an overall
                        warmer feeling.

                        Carpet is ideal for cushioning our footsteps, reducing slips and falls, and minimizing injuries
                        when falls do occur. Carpet provides safety protection for the whole family, but especially for toddlers and older
                        individuals.

                        Carpet helps to absorb these sounds. Adding a cushion pad beneath your carpet reduces noise even
                        further. Carpet also works as a sound barrier between floors by helping to block sound transmission to
                        rooms below. Carpet on stairs also helps mask the sound of constant foot traffic.

        <h2 id="Welcome">TYPES OF CARPET</h2>
        <h3>Woven</h3>
        <p>
            The carpet is produced on a loom quite similar to woven fabric. The pile can be plush or Berber.
            Plush carpet is a cut pile and Berber carpet is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the
            two styles called cut and loop carpeting.
            Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from
            predetermined designs
            (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the
            carpet).
            These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process.
            These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan, and Arabia.
        </p>
        <h3>Needle Felt</h3>
        <p>
            These carpets are more technologically advanced. Needle felts are produced by intermingling and felting
            individual synthetic fibers
            using barbed and forked needles forming an extremely durable carpet. These carpets are normally found in
            commercial settings
            such as hotels and restaurants where there is frequent traffic.
        </p>
        <h3>Knotted</h3>
        <p>
            On a knotted pile carpet (formally, a "supplementary weft cut-loop pile" carpet), the structural weft
            threads alternate with a
            supplementary weft that rises at right angles to the surface of the weave. This supplementary weft is
            attached to the warp by one of three knot types
            such as shag carpet which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or nap of the carpet. Knotting by hand
            is most prevalent
            in oriental rugs and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be
            woven on a loom.
            Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental carpets. The
            warp threads are set up on the frame of the loom
            before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed
            and cut. The knots are secured with
            (usually one to four) rows of weft. The warp in woven carpet is usually cotton and the weft is jute.

            There are several styles of knotting, but the two main types of knot are the symmetrical (also called
            Turkish or Ghiordes) and asymmetrical (also called Persian or Senna).
            Contemporary centres of knotted carpet production are: Lahore and Peshawar (Pakistan), Kashmir (India),
            Mirzapur and Bhadohi (India),[6]Tabriz (Iran), Afghanistan,
            Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Northern Africa, Nepal, Spain, Turkmenistan, and Tibet. The importance of
            carpets in the culture of Turkmenistan is such that the national flag
            features a vertical red stripe near the hoist side, containing five carpet guls (designs used in producing
            rugs). Kashmir is known for handknotted carpets of silk or wool.
        </p>
        <h3>Tufted</h3>
        <p>
            These are carpets that have their pile injected into a backing material, which is itself then bonded to a
            secondary backing made of a woven hessian weave or a man made alternative
            to provide stability. The pile is often sheared in order to achieve different textures. This is the most
            common method of manufacturing of domestic carpets for floor covering purposes
            in the world.
        </p>
        <h3>Others</h3>
        <p>
            A flatweave carpet is created by interlocking warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads. Types of
            oriental flatwoven carpet include kilim, soumak, plain weave, and tapestry weave.
            Types of European flatwoven carpets include Venetian, Dutch, damask, list, haircloth, and ingrain (aka
            double cloth, two-ply, triple cloth, or three-ply).

            A hooked rug is a simple type of rug handmade by pulling strips of cloth such as wool or cotton through the
            meshes of a sturdy fabric such as burlap. This type of rug is now generally made as a handicraft.
            The process of creating a hooked rug is called Rug hooking.

            Unlike woven carpets, embroidery carpets' are not formed on a loom. Their pattern is established by the
            application of stitches to a cloth (often linen) base. The tent stitch and the cross stitch are two of the
            most common.
            Embroidered carpets were traditionally made by royal and aristocratic women in the home, but there has been
            some commercial manufacture since steel needles were introduced (earlier needles were made of bone) and
            linen weaving improved
            in the 16th century. Mary, Queen of Scots, is known to have been an avid embroiderer. 16th century designs
            usually involve scrolling vines and regional flowers (for example, the Bradford carpet).
            They often incorporate animal heraldry and the coat of arms of the maker. Production continued through the
            19th century. Victorian embroidered carpet compositions include highly illusionistic, 3-dimensional flowers.
            Patterns for tiled carpets made of a number of squares, called Berlin wool work, were introduced in Germany
            in 1804, and became extremely popular in England in the 1830s. Embroidered carpets can also include other
            features such as a pattern of shapes,
            or they can even tell a story.
        </p>
        <h2>Fibres And Yarns</h2>
        <p>
            Carpet can be formulated from many single or blended natural and synthetic fibres. Fibres are chosen for
            durability, appearance, ease of manufacture, and cost. In terms of scale of production, the dominant yarn
            constructions are polyamides (nylons) and polypropylene
            with an estimated 90% of the commercial market
        </p>
        <h3>Nylon</h3>
        <p>
            Since the 20th century, nylon is one of the most common materials for the construction of carpets. Both
            nylon 6 and nylon 6-6 are used. Nylon can be dyed topically or dyed in a molten state (solution dying).
            Nylon can be printed easily and has excellent wear characteristics.
            Due to nylon's excellent wear-resistance, it is widely used in industrial and commercial carpeting. In
            carpets, nylon tends to stain easily due to the presence of dye sites. These dye sites need to be filled in
            order to give nylon carpet any type of stain resistance.
            As nylon is petroleum-based it varies in price with the price of oil.
        </p>
        <h3>Polypropylene</h3>
        <p>
            Polypropylene, a polyolefin stiffer than the cheaper polyethylene, is used to produce carpet yarns because
            it is still less expensive than the other materials used for carpets. It is difficult to dye and does not
            wear as well as wool or nylon. Polypropylene, sometimes referred to simply as "olefin",
            is commonly used to construct berber carpets. Large looped olefin berber carpets are usually only suited for
            light domestic use and tend to mat down quickly. Berber carpets with smaller loops tend to be more resilient
            and retain their new appearance longer than large looped berber styles.
            Commercial grade level-loop carpets have very small loops, and commercial grade cut-pile styles can be well
            constructed. When made with polypropylene, commercial grade styles wear very well, making them very suitable
            for areas with heavy foot traffic such as offices.
            Polypropylene carpets are known to have good stain resistance, but not against oil- based agents. If a stain
            does set, it can be difficult to clean. Commercial grade carpets can be glued directly to the floor or
            installed over a 1/4" thick, 8-pound density padding.
            Outdoor grass carpets are usually made from polypropylene.
        </p>
        <h3>Wool And Wool-Blends</h3>
        <p>
            Wool has excellent durability, can be dyed easily and is fairly abundant. When blended with synthetic fibres
            such as nylon the durability of wool is increased. Blended wool yarns are extensively used in production of
            modern carpet, with the most common blend being 80% wool to 20% synthetic fibre,
            giving rise to the term "80/20". Wool is relatively expensive and consequently it only comprises a small
            portion of the market.
        </p>
        <h3>Polyester</h3>
        <p>
            The polyester known as "PET" (polyethylene terephthalate) is used in carpet manufacturing in both spun and
            filament constructions. After the price of raw materials for many types of carpet rose in the early 2000s,
            polyester became more competitive. Polyester has good physical properties and is inherently stain-resistant
            because
            it is hydrophobic, however oil based stains can pose a problem for this type of material and it can be prone
            to soiling. Similar to nylon, colour can be added after production or it can be infused in a molten state
            (solution dyeing). Polyester has the disadvantage that it tends to crush or mat down easily.
            It is typically used in mid- to low-priced carpeting.

            Another polyester, "PTT" (Polytrimethylene terephthalate), also called Sorona or 3GT (Dupont) or Corterra
            (Shell), is a variant of PET. Lurgi Zimmer PTT was first patented in 1941, but it was not produced until the
            1990s, when Shell Chemicals developed the low-cost method of producing high-quality 1,3 propanediol (PDO),
            the starting raw material for PTT Corterra Polymers. DuPont subsequently commercialized a biological process
            for making 1,3-propanediol from corn syrup, imparting significant renewable content on the corresponding
            Sorona polyester carpet fibers. These carpet fibers have resiliency comparable to nylon.
        </p>
        <h3>Acrylic</h3>
        <p>
            Acrylic is a synthetic material first created by the Dupont Corporation in 1941 but has gone through various
            changes since it was first introduced. In the past, acrylic carpet used to fuzz or "pill" easily. This
            happened when the fibres degraded over time and short strands broke away with contact or friction. Over the
            years,
            new types of acrylics have been developed to alleviate some of these problems, although the issues have not
            been completely removed. Acrylic is fairly difficult to dye but is colourfast, washable, and has the feel
            and appearance of wool, making it a good rug fabric.
