        <h2>ORIGIN OF CARPET</h2>


        <p>From the earliest times, man has used various means to separate himself from the cold, discomforting ground or floor surface he walked, sat, and slept on. Even before recorded history, animal hides, and furs were used for this purpose. As time progressed, a variety of natural and fabricated materials have been used to provide a better level of comfort and durability.
            The oldest carpet ever discovered is the Pazyryk carpet, which is a pile carpet rug discovered in a Siberian Burial Mound in 1949. Experts believe it is over 6,000 years old, dating back to the 5th century B.C.</p>
            <p>Preserved in ice for thousands of years, this rug of unknown origin measuring approximately 5 x 6 feet, has all the characteristics of a Modern, Persian, or Anatolian rug with a pile and Ghiordes knot.
                The rug’s dominant tile-work central motif is surrounded by borders featuring rows of elk and horsemen.Over the centuries, gradual improvements in weaving and evolution in design have produced more elaborate patterns. Even though weaving soon became common throughout much of the world, each ethnic group produced quite different designs for different purposes. </p>
            <p>In the Middle East, rug and carpet-making became a home industry where individuals would make rugs for their own use. In their spare time, they would make extras to sell at a later date or use as payment for other goods and services.
                In fact, carpets were readily accepted for payment of dowries, to buy livestock or to pay off taxes. In India however, rugs were almost exclusively woven for the Mogul (Mughal) rulers and did not penetrate into the daily lives of the common people.In China, handmade rugs were essentially ornamental and made for those of high stature and wealth who could afford to purchase them or have them made.</p>
                <h3>Persian Carpets</h3>
                <p>
                    Persia, the ancient Persian name of Iran, boasts to be the world's most superior culture in carpet manufacturing. The art of weaving and dying is inherited and carpets of all styles and sizes are made here. The Turkish speaking part of the population often uses the Senneh knot.
                    The carpets manufactured are often named after the areas where they are made, for example, Hamadan, Mashad, Kerman (or Kirman), Shiraz, and Bidjar.
                </p>
                <p>The art, architecture, and handicraft products were developed during the Safavids period, especially during the rule of Shah Abbas the Great, who reigned 1587-1629.
                Since 1979, the country has become an Islamic republic. The oil provides the largest export income, but when it comes to occupation carpet manufacturing dominates. Millions of Iranians are involved in some way with the manufacturing of carpets; either through sheep raising, cutting, spinning, dyeing, weaving, washing, repairing, or sales.
For a visitor in Iran, it soon becomes obvious that the carpets play a big role in society. In the big cities, the exclusive carpet shops are packed tightly together. On the streets, one can see small trucks with carpets on the platforms on their way to bazaars. Looms, tools, and yarns are for sale everywhere.
Out in the countryside, looms are seen in the homes and out in the open. Sometimes someone may have spread out a carpet on the street and is washing it with water and a brush.</p>
<p>
    For many people in the west, oriental carpets are synonymous with Persian carpets. This is of course not correct, but the mistake is understandable considering the influences of Persian carpet manufacturing worldwide.
    The Swedish writer Knut Larson says in his book about oriental carpets: "The Persians preserve their carpet culture carefully. Their art of weaving carpets is something superior, it is the best in the world".
</p>
<h3>Turkish Carpets</h3>
<p>
    Turkish carpets are sometimes also named Anatolian carpets. The oldest Turkish carpets found, originate from the 13th century and can be found in the city of Konya, which for a long time was the center for Turkish carpet manufacturing. Carpets that were made in the 16th and 17th centuries are fully comparable with the Persian carpets.
    Rug weaving in Anatolia first began with the arrival of the Turkish tribes from Central Asia, who settled in this region. Therefore, Anatolian rugs form a branch of ethnic Turkish rugs.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the oldest examples known are the eighteen surviving pieces woven by the Seljuk Turks in the 13th century. The motifs in these pieces represented in stylized floral and geometrical patterns in several basic colors and were woven in Sivas, Kayseri, and Konya provinces.
    The Turkish carpets are highly influenced by the Greeks which back in a time dominated carpet manufacturing. The carpets which are thicker consist of wool, cotton, and silk and are always tied with a Turkish knot, also called Ghiordes knot or Turkbaff.
Commonly used patterns are based on prayer niches with more geometrical motifs.Humans and animals are not portrayed since the Quran does not allow this.
</p>
<h3>Carpets In Pakistan</h3>
<p>
    The art of weaving developed in South Asia at a time when few other civilizations employed it. Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro– ancient cities of the Indus Valley Civilization– have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. 
    Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles. As of the late 1990s, hand-knotted carpets were among Pakistan's leading export products and their manufacture is the second largest cottage and small industry. 
    Pakistani craftsmen have the capacity to produce any type of carpet using all the popular motifs of gulls, medallions, paisleys, traceries, and geometric designs in various combinations. At the time of independence, manufacturing of carpets was set up in Sangla Hill, a small town of District Sheikhupura. 
    Chaudary Mukhtar Ahmad Member son of Maher Ganda introduced and taught this art to locals and immigrants. He is considered founder of this industry in Pakistan. Sangla Hill is now a focal point of the carpet industry in Pakistan. 
    Almost all the exporters and manufacturers who are running their business at Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi have their area offices in Sangla Hill.
</p>
<h3>Carpets In India</h3>
<p>
    Carpet weaving may have been introduced into the area as far back as the eleventh century with the coming of the first Muslim conquerors, the Ghaznavids and the Ghauri's, from the West.
    The beginning of the Mughal Dynasty in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, Babar, extended his rule from Kabul to India to found the Mughal Empire.
It is said that when Babur came to India, he was disappointed by the lack of luxuries here. He missed the luxuries of Persia, which included the Persian carpet.
</p>
<p>
    Akbar laid the foundation of carpet weaving tradition in India, in 1520 AD, when he brought some carpet weavers from Persia, at his palace in Agra. With their support, he established carpet weavings centers at Agra, Delhi, and Lahore to facilitate the production of Persian styled carpets, which were inspired by the designs of Kirman, Kashan, Isfahan, and Herat.
    King Akbar, who was an illiterate himself was a great propagator of the arts and culture and it was during his reign that the arts flourished in India. Because of a lot of commotion in the jails, he decided to reform the system.
Between 1520-30's he instructed the carpet weavers from Persia he brought with him, some of the finest carpet weavers from the most well-known carpet workshops of Persia, to teach the prisoners the art of weaving carpets. These jailbirds took a lot of pride in their work and they eventually outshone their masters.
</p>
<p>
    Initially, the carpets woven showed the classic Persian style of fine knotting. Gradually it blended with Indian art. Thus, the carpets produced became typical of Indian origin and gradually the industry began to diversify and spread all over the subcontinent.
    During the Mughal period, the carpets made on the Indian subcontinent became so famous that the demand for them spread abroad. These carpets had distinctive designs and boasted a high density of knots.
Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan, were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase.
Indian carpets are well known for their designs with attention to detail and presentation of realistic attributes. The carpet industry in India flourished more in its northern part with major centers found in Kashmir, Jaipur, Agra, and Bhadohi.
Today, India is the world's largest producer and exporter of handmade carpets in terms of value and volume. Around 75–85 percent of carpets manufactured in India are exported. Indian carpets are known worldwide for their excellent design, fascinating colors, and quality.

<h3>Carpets In England</h3>
<p>
    Knotted pile carpet weaving technology probably came to England in the early 16th century with Flemish Calvinists fleeing religious persecution. Because many of these weavers settled in south-eastern England, particularly in Norwich, the 14 extant 16th and 17th century carpets are sometimes referred to as "Norwich carpets". These works are either adaptations of Anatolian or Indo-Persian designs, or employ Elizabethan-Jacobean scrolling vines and blossoms; all but one are dated or bear a coat of arms. Like the French, English weavers used the symmetrical knot. There are documented and surviving examples of carpets from three 18th-century manufactories: Exeter (1756–1761, owned by Claude Passavant, 3 extant carpets), Moorfields (1752–1806, owned by Thomas Moore, 5 extant), and Axminster (1755–1835, owned by Thomas Whitty, numerous extant).
    Exeter and Moorfields were both staffed with renegade weavers from the French Savonnerie and, therefore, employ the weaving structure of that factory and Perrot-inspired designs. Neoclassical designer Robert Adam supplied designs for both Moorfields and Axminster carpets based on Roman floor mosaics and coffered ceilings. Some of the most well-known rugs of his design were made for Syon House, Osterley House, Harewood House, Saltram House, and Newby Hall.
</p>
<h4>Axminster</h4>
<p>
    Axminster carpet was a unique floor covering first made in a factory founded at Axminster, Devon, in 1755 by the cloth weaver Thomas Whitty. Resembling somewhat the Savonnerie carpets produced in France, Axminster carpets were symmetrically knotted by hand in wool on woollen warps, and had a weft of flax or hemp. Like the French carpets, they often featured Renaissance architectural or floral patterns; others mimicked oriental patterns. Similar carpets were produced at the same time in Exeter and in the Moorfields area of London and, shortly before, at Fulham in Middlesex. The Whitty factory closed in 1835 with the advent of machine-made carpeting. The name Axminster, however, survived as a generic term for machine-made carpets whose pile is produced by techniques similar to those used in making velvet or chenille,[53] and Axminster Carpets Ltd resumed production at a new site in the town in 1937.[54]
    Axminster carpets can use the three main types of broadloom carpet construction: machine-woven, tufted and hand-knotted. Machine-woven carpet is an investment that will last 20 or 30 years, and woven Axminster and Wilton carpets are still popular in areas where longevity and design flexibility are a big part of the purchasing decision. Hotels and leisure venues almost always choose these types, and many homes use woven Axminsters as design statements.
Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton are made by massive looms that weave together 'bobbins' of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make: a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing, which is then held in place with underlying "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, so that in the finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from faraway continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate mistake on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.
Six patterns of Axminster carpet are known as the Lansdowne group. These have a tripartite design with reeded circles and baskets of flowers in the central panel, flanked by diamond lozenges in the side panels. Axminster Rococo designs often have a brown ground and include birds copied from popular, contemporary engravings. Even now a large percentage of the 55,000 population of the town still seek employment in this industry.

<h4>Brussels and Wilton</h4>
<p>
    The town of Wilton, Wiltshire is also known for its carpet weaving, which dates back to the 18th century.The Brussels loom was introduced into England towards the middle of the eighteenth century and marked the beginning of a new era in carpet-weaving. It was the first loom on which a pile carpet could be woven mechanically, the pile consisting of rows of loops, formed over wires inserted weftwise during weaving and subsequently withdrawn. Brussels was the first type of carpet to be woven in a loom incorporating the Jacquard pattern-selecting mechanism, and in 1849 power was applied to the loom by Biglow in the United States.
Later, when bladed wires were developed, the pile loops were severed on withdrawal of the wires to produce a carpet known as Wilton, and after this development the loom became known as the Wilton loom. In modern usage the designation Wilton applies to both cut-pile and loop-pile carpets made in this loom. The latter are now variously described as Brussels-Wilton, round wire Wilton, loop-pile Wilton, and round wired Jacquard. The methods of manufacture, including the principles of design, preparatory processes, and weaving, are the same in most respects for both Brussels and Wilton qualities. The chief difference between them is that whereas Brussels loop-pile is secured satisfactorily by the insertion of two picks of weft to each wire (2-shot), the Wilton cut-pile is woven more often with three picks of weft to each wire (3-shot) to ensure that the tufts are firmly secured in the carpet backing.
Brussels carpets have a smooth slightly ribbed surface and their patterning is well defined, a characteristic feature of the carpet. Closeness of pile rather than height contributes to their neat appearance and hard wearing properties, although they do not simulate the luxury of cut-pile carpets. Brussels Wilton carpets were initially produced on 27-inch (3/4) looms and were sewn together by hand. The looms could incorporate up to five frames, each with a different colour, thus enabling figured or pattern carpets to be manufactured. With judicial and skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could be increased to about twenty, enabling complex designs to be produced. Due to the additional costs in labour these carpets were normally only produced for the bespoke market.
After the First World War, the carpets started to be produced for the general market using popular designs and colourways but they always remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class of the twentieth century aspired to acquire a Wilton carpet for their 'best' room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where Brussels Wilton carpets were produced remained centred around the towns of Wilton, Kidderminster in the West Midlands, and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different manufacturing methods and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their décor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive Brussels Wilton carpets. Very few of the original ¾ Wilton looms still exist, and the few that do are either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce custom made luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad
