## UX


### Design Choices



### Colors
- The Colour combination used in this project represents the clarity and contrast which creates appealing sensation.
- Contrast is the most important thing regarding the choice of colours. So, it could be easy for young ones who are still learning "symbols" that are letters and words and also for older people having visual impairment.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validation Testing
You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation. In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

CSS Validator Note, any error associated with root: color variables were ignored.
HTML Validator
Note any errors or warnings you are ignorning and why. IT IS BEST NOT to have ERRORS, but COLOR VARIABLES sometimes are ok to ignore if you say the IDE that has the correct linters noted no errors. Or you can take the rendered HTML and run it through the HTML validator for the Flask html templates.

Ideally you would bullet point your each of your HTML files and each ofyour CSS files and add a screenshot of the validation tool's output proving all was good.


### Automated Testing
Whenever it is feasible, automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

If you did not run automating testing. State why you chose not to. (Lacking the skill set or time is totally valid, just let the assessor know)

### Manual Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant.

You can track your test in various ways choose the one you are comfortable with and have time to do:
### Defects of Note
Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and how you finally ended up resolving them.

### Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found. If you know of something that isn't quite right, list it out and explain why you chose not to resolve it.
