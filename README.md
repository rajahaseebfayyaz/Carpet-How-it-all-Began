## UX


### Design Choices



### Colors
- The Colour combination used in this project represents the clarity and contrast which creates appealing sensation.
- Contrast is the most important thing regarding the choice of colours. So, it could be easy for young ones who are still learning "symbols" that are letters and words and also for older people having visual impairment.

###Â Typography
- The fonts used in Carpet-How-it-Began improves the visual presentation of the content.
- Oswald is used for headings and menus whereas Lato is used for paragraph content,Both complement nicely to each other while remaining easy to read.
- Weight for the font used is 300 as it looks sleek and professional.

### Images
Explain why you used certain icons and images on your site



## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Implemented Features

#### NAVIGATION

- 


For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

It's easiest to break this section down into the header, footer, layer, and each page of your website. Call out any differences for mobile vs desktop presentations, include a screenshot.

Don't forget your 404 error page.

Future Features
Use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

If you end up not developing some features you hoped to implement, you can include those in this section.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

If you included a js file that isn't your own, add it here.

If you included a css file that isn't your own, add it here.

Common 3rd party technologies to list:

wirefames
favicons
color palette images
fonts
CSS Frameworks
markdown tables
markdown table of contents
Please note, if this gets more than 5 items, you may want to break it down into logical subsections

Programing Languages
JQuery The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
CSS The project uses CSS to define DOM appearance.
HTML The project uses HTML to define DOM elements.
Markdown Documentation within the readme was generated using markdown
Frameworks and Extensions
Bootstrap 4.0 Rather than re-invent many things, I chose to customize the look and feel of bootstrap 4.0
google sheets & drive - Used to create testing documents and project plan (feature to do list)
Fonts
FontAwesome - for icons associated with buttons and inputs
Patrick Hand SC - Google Font's Patrick Hand font was used for headers and home page dialog
Raleway - Google's Raleway font was used as the main font
Tools
github - used for version control of project files and branching out to try different things without adversely affecting a functional set of code
balsamiq - used to create professional looking wire frames.
markdown table generator - used to help with documentation table formatting
mardown table of contents generator - used to create table of contents (be weary it does have some bugs if you have dashes or trailing spaces in your headers)
colors.co I used a colors.co's color pallet tool to help pick complementary colors.
APIs
SMTP - Send emails to users
Google Maps Javascript API - Customized Mapping Widgets
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Validation Testing
You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation. In this section you should write up any websites you used to validate your code. As your projects becomes more complex these tools may change.

CSS Validator Note, any error associated with root: color variables were ignored.
HTML Validator
Note any errors or warnings you are ignorning and why. IT IS BEST NOT to have ERRORS, but COLOR VARIABLES sometimes are ok to ignore if you say the IDE that has the correct linters noted no errors. Or you can take the rendered HTML and run it through the HTML validator for the Flask html templates.

Ideally you would bullet point your each of your HTML files and each ofyour CSS files and add a screenshot of the validation tool's output proving all was good.

Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

TOOL / Device	BROWSER	OS	SCREEN WIDTH
real phone: motog6	chrome	android	XS 360 x 640
browser stack: iPhone5s	safari	iOs	XS 320 x 568
dev tools emulator: pixel 2	firefox	android	SM 411 x 731
browserstack: iPhone 10x	Chrome	iOs	SM 375 x 812
browserstack: nexus 7 - vert	Chrome	android	M 600 x 960
real tablet: ipad mini - vert	safari	iOs	M 768 x 1024
browserstack: nexus 7 - horiz	firefox	android	LG 960 x 600
chrome emulator: ipad - horiz	safari	iOs	LG 1024 x 768
browserstack	Chrome	windows	XL 1920 x 946
real computer: mac book pro	safari 12.1	Mohave	XL 1400 x 766
browserstack	IE Edge 88	windows 10	XL 1920 x 964
Automated Testing
Whenever it is feasible, automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

If you did not run automating testing. State why you chose not to. (Lacking the skill set or time is totally valid, just let the assessor know)

Manual Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant.

You can track your test in various ways choose the one you are comfortable with and have time to do:

Markdown
A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact Page Go to the Register page: http://YOUR_APP.com/contact.html

 Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
 Try to submit the form with an invalid email format and verify that a relevant error message appears
 Try to submit the form with an invalid password format and verify that a relevant error message appears
 Try to submit the form with an existing username, should re-render page with relevant error message/warning
 Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears and user is on profile page
Spreadsheet
Here is a Manual Testing Template that you can use as a starting point to keep track of your testing efforts. Make a copy of it in your own account and update as needed to reflect the browsers you are testing and features.

GitHub Issues, Milestones & Boards
You can also use agile tools in github to help track your testing and defects. Here's a document that I put together about that process

It's ok to spot check specific functionality across devices and browsers but each page should be viewed as a whole for each device/browser combo at least once.

A quick way to check if items are exceeding the screen width of a project is to run this javascript in the console for various screen emulations:

var docWidth = document.documentElement.offsetWidth;
[].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('*'),function(el){if(el.offsetWidth > docWidth){console.log(el);}});
Defect Tracking
You should mention any bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

Here is a Defect Tracking Template you use as a starting point to track defects. Make a copy of the sheet to your own account and update the Features sheet to match your project.

Again, you could use github issues to track you defects. Or write them up with markdown.

### Defects of Note
Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and how you finally ended up resolving them.

Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found. If you know of something that isn't quite right, list it out and explain why you chose not to resolve it.

## Deployment
- The site was deployed to github pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:-
- In the Github repository, navigate to settings page.
- From the source section drops-down menu, select the Master Branch.
- Once the master branch has been selected ,the page provided the link to the completed website.

- The live link can be found here:-
